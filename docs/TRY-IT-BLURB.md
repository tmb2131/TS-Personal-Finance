**Findash** (you’ll see it as “TS Personal Finance”) is a personal finance dashboard that pulls data from a Google Sheet and shows net worth, budgets vs actuals, spending trends, cash runway, and an AI assistant you can ask questions in plain English.

I built it over the past week while learning how AI can build real apps—not just answer questions or summarize stuff. So think of it as a work-in-progress experiment as much as a tool.

**To try it:**

1. Sign in with your Google account.
2. You’ll land on Key Insights. A popup will ask for a Google Spreadsheet ID—paste this one to use my dummy data: **1BxVuJ-DViN5nqpLc-8tGXex_pYiPY8dfL8UV5czCrHY**
3. Click **Save and start**. The app will sync that sheet and refresh so you see data right away.
4. Then poke around **Dashboard**, **Key Insights**, **Accounts**, and **Analysis**. The floating chat button opens the AI Financial Assistant—try “What’s my net worth?” or “How’s my budget vs actual?”

Your data stays in your account only. You can change or disconnect the sheet anytime in Settings. Have fun, and let me know what you think.
